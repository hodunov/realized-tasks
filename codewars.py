Pete, the baker
Pete likes to bake some cakes. He has some recipes and ingredients.

Write a function cakes(), which takes the recipe (object) and the available ingredients (also an object)
and returns the maximum number of cakes Pete can bake (integer). For simplicity there are no units for the amounts
(e.g. 1 lb of flour or 200 g of sugar are simply 1 or 200). Ingredients that are not present in the objects, can be considered as 0.

First non-repeating character

Write a function named first_non_repeating_letter that takes a string input, 
and returns the first character that is not repeated anywhere in the string.
For example, if given the input 'stress', the function should return 't', 
since the letter t only occurs once in the string, and occurs first in the string.
As an added challenge, upper- and lowercase letters are considered the same character, 
but the function should return the correct case for the initial letter. 
For example, the input 'sTreSS' should return 'T'.
If a string contains all repeating characters, it should return an empty string ("") or None

Human readable duration format

Your task in order to complete this Kata is to write a function which formats a duration, given as a number of seconds, in a human-friendly way.

The function must accept a non-negative integer. If it is zero, it just returns "now". Otherwise, the duration is expressed as a combination of years, days, hours, minutes and seconds.

It is much easier to understand with an example:

format_duration(62)    # returns "1 minute and 2 seconds"
format_duration(3662)  # returns "1 hour, 1 minute and 2 seconds"
For the purpose of this Kata, a year is 365 days and a day is 24 hours.
