In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

Example:

high_and_low("1 2 3 4 5")  # return "5 1"
high_and_low("1 2 -3 4 5") # return "5 -3"
high_and_low("1 9 3 4 -5") # return "9 -5"
"""

# print(high_and_low("4 5 29 54 4 0 -214 544 -64 1 -3 6 -6"))

"""
There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

find_uniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) == 2
find_uniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) == 0.55
Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.
"""

# Best practice: 
def find_uniq(arr):
    a, b = set(arr)
    return a if arr.count(a) == 1 else b

# Another var
def find_uniq(arr):
    a = sorted(arr)
    print(a)
    return a[0] if a[0] != a[1] else a[-1]

"""
Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized (known as Upper Camel Case, also often referred to as Pascal case).

Examples
to_camel_case("the-stealth-warrior") # returns "theStealthWarrior"

to_camel_case("The_Stealth_Warrior") # returns "TheStealthWarrior"
"""


def to_camel_case(text):

# print(to_camel_case("the-stealth_warrior"))
# print(to_camel_case("A_B-C"))


"""
Write a function called that takes a string of parentheses, and determines if the order of the parentheses is valid. The function should return true if the string is valid, and false if it's invalid.

Examples
"()"              =>  true
")(()))"          =>  false
"("               =>  false
"(())((()())())"  =>  true
